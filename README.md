# Inspiration

During the quarantine, social interactions dwindled, challenging individuals, including ourselves, to adapt from text-only to full-fledged conversations post-pandemic. The struggle persisted, particularly in facing public speeches and presentations. Recognizing the increasing prevalence of social anxiety, we developed Verbalyst to address these challenges.

# What It Does

Verbalyst empowers users to rehearse and record speeches, analyzing both audio and video for stutters. It encourages regular practice, essential for universal speaking skills applicable in various contexts. Users can track their progress through the STATS page, while the app also offers a tongue twister generator for a fun challenge in identifying and eliminating speech-related issues.

# How It's Built

The technology stack includes HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with Flask connecting it to the Python backend. Google Vertex AI handles AI-generated speech analysis, while AssemblyAI performs speech-to-text on user-uploaded mp4 files.

# Challenges Faced During Hackathon

Scheduling conflicts led to a 26-hour delay, presenting a significant challenge. Despite the setback, we adapted swiftly, optimizing our time. The end product was slightly below our initial expectations, but both AI components function independently.

# What We Learned

Verbalyst was a profound learning journey. Developing the recording feature, integrating it with AssemblyAI's speech-to-text model, and using Flask were new experiences. Although full integration wasn't achieved in the given time, insights into AssemblyAI and audio-to-text conversion were gained. Adopting TailwindCSS for markup added another layer of learning, showcasing our dedication to acquiring new skills throughout the project.
